# Fresh AWS Upload Demo

A quick demo to show file uploads with Fresh. Make sure to set the environment
variables and rename `.example.env` to `.env`. Other than that, it should work
out of the box.

### Usage

Start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
